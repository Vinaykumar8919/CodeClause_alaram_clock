1. Import the necessary modules:
   - `tkinter`: The standard Python interface for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI).
   - `datetime`: Used to work with dates and times.
   - `time`: Provides various time-related functions.
   - `winsound`: Enables you to play sounds on Windows.

2. Define the `set_alarm()` function:
   - This function is called when the user clicks the "Set Alarm" button.
   - It gets the alarm time entered by the user from the `entry` widget using `entry.get()`.
   - It displays a label indicating that the alarm is set to the entered time.
   - The function then enters a `while True` loop that continuously checks the current time using `datetime.datetime.now()`.
   - If the current time matches the alarm time, the `play_alarm()` function is called to play a sound, and the loop breaks to stop checking for the alarm.

3. Define the `play_alarm()` function:
   - This function plays a sound when the alarm goes off using `winsound.Beep(frequency, duration)`.
   - The frequency and duration determine the sound that will be played. In this example, a beep sound is played with a frequency of 2500 Hz and a duration of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).

4. Create the Tkinter window:
   - A new Tkinter window is created using `tk.Tk()`.
   - The window's title is set to "Alarm Clock".

5. Create label and entry widgets:
   - A label widget is created with the text "Enter alarm time (HH:MM):" using `tk.Label()`.
   - An entry widget is created using `tk.Entry()` to allow the user to input the alarm time.

6. Create a button to set the alarm:
   - A button widget is created with the text "Set Alarm".
   - The `command` parameter is set to the `set_alarm()` function, which means the function will be called when the button is clicked.

7. Start the Tkinter event loop:
   - The `window.mainloop()` function is called to start the GUI event loop, which handles user interactions and updates the GUI.
